If your chargeback rate has decreased after that period, your payouts will resume as normal. To be sure, you will still be able to make sales, create new products, contact your customers, and promote your products. The only thing that has changed is your payouts.<br /><br />We don't do this to penalize you - this is a compromise we have struck with our banking partners. In the past, we would have been forced to suspend your account and refund your sales, but in the process, we hurt a lot of legitimate, honest creators. This is a measure to ensure that you can continue selling with us.<br /><br />If customers who have issued chargebacks against you cancel their disputes, and your chargeback rate is thus lowered, we may be able to resume your payouts before the 30 days are up. We recommend that you reach out to your customers and ask them to do so.<br /><br />This article talks in detail about <a href=\"https://help.gumroad.com/article/134-how-does-gumroad-handle-chargebacks\">how Gumroad handles chargebacks</a>.<br /><br />Thanks for your patience and understanding!<br />"

Chargebacks are handled by the customer’s bank (or PayPal) directly and most banks allow customers to dispute a purchase up to 120 days after the purchase date.<br /><br />We fight all card chargebacks on your behalf in line with our process outlined <a href=\"https://help.gumroad.com/article/134-how-does-gumroad-handle-chargebacks\">here</a>. However, if the disputed purchase was made via <a href=\"https://help.gumroad.com/article/275-paypal-connect\">PayPal Connect</a>, you need to handle the dispute from your own PayPal Resolution Center.<br /><br />Please note customers automatically lose access to the content of the disputed purchase and are not allowed to make further purchases on Gumroad until they cancel all open chargebacks.<br /><br />Hope that helps.

Their access will remain active until the end of the billing period, so they should lose access after the period they paid for ends, not when they request cancelation.</li></ol>If a customer is still in your server when they are no longer supposed to be and you've checked that the above aren't true for them, please let us know their purchase email so we can investigate further.<br />Finally, a common question we get is if the Gumroad bot is working even when it's “offline”.

If it is, we'll email you, and provide you with a 10 day window to react. We'll ask them for a re-review, and they'll then let us know if you can continue using Gumroad. <br /><br />So, for the meantime, I would be cautious about your products' descriptions (don't advertise that they can be used for NSFW purposes) and thumbnails.<br /><br />Thanks again!

      "content": "Hey there,<br /><br /> I’m happy to clarify why the review is taking longer than expected.<br /><br /> It appears that most of the products you sell are NSFW or adult. I do see you’ve reached the $10 threshold, but if you read through our Help Center article on <a href=\"http://help.gumroad.com/11164-payments/getting-paid\">how payouts work</a> and <a href=\"https://help.gumroad.com/article/156-gumroad-and-adult-content\">Adult Content on Gumroad</a>, we lay out the situation accordingly.<br /><br /><strong>What does that mean?</strong><br /> Because your account is NSFW, and NSFW accounts are inherently higher risk, our banking partners will not allow us to pay you until we have enough data from your sales (in other words - more than ~6 unique customers). We have to prove to them that your account is not a financial liability.<br /><br /> After you've made your first sale, your account will be reviewed by our Risk team. If your account has not been marked as compliant by our Risk team, you cannot be paid.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, if there is a backlog with our Risk team, or your account has not accrued enough sales to be fully investigated, there may be a delay in your payouts.<br /><br /><strong>Why do we do this?</strong><br /> Because tons of scammers have attempted to use Gumroad in the past to launder money. One of their favorite techniques is making a handful of small, legitimate-seeming sales, then after being paid out once, ratcheting up the fraud and laundering thousands of dollars through our site. As a result, we have to prove to our banking partners and processors that all accounts being paid out are legitimate. We must catch these accounts in their first few sales before they seriously impact our business.<br /><br /> As an unfortunate side effect, this means that all of our legitimate creators have to make more than a couple of sales before we can pay them. This is even more crucial for creators selling adult content.<br /><br /> Thank you for your patience and understanding. Let me know if you have any issues or concerns!<br />"
